## Stellar JS Utils  

### High level calls to Stellar JS SDK

Still a work in progress, UI not perfect yet, but everything should work fine.

Includes:
+ Donate dialog with Ledger nano support.
+ Bifrost dialog for buying tokens.

See [Stellar Client](https://github.com/StellarKit/stellar-client) for an example of using this package

The UI uses Vuetify and VueJS, so these dialogs will only work within a vuetify v-app tag

Don't worry Vue and Vuetify are awesome and it should be simple to integrate within any website.

Check out https://vuetifyjs.com for more details.

Build:
```
yarn dist
```

Pull requests welcome!
